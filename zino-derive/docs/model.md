Derives the [`Model`](zino_core::model::Model) trait.

# Attributes on struct fields

- **`#[schema(constructor = "path")]`**: The `constructor` attribute is used to
  create a new instance of the column type in `Model::new()`.
  The function must be callable as `fn() -> T`.

- **`#[schema(read_only)]`**: The `read_only` annotation indicates that
  the column is read-only and can not be modified after creation.
  It also can not been seen in the model definition.

- **`#[schema(generated)]`**: The `generated` annotation indicates that
  the column value is generated by the backend and do not need any frontend input.
  The column will not been seen in the model definition.

- **`#[schema(reserved)]`**: The `generated` annotation is used to mark a special column.
  It will not been seen in the model definition. Built-in reserved fields:
  **`created_at`** | **`updated_at`** | **`deleted_at`** | **`is_deleted`** | **`is_locked`**
  | **`is_archived`** | **`version`** | **`edition`**.

- **`#[schema(auto_initialized)]`**: The `auto_initialized` annotation indicates that
  the column has an automatically initialized value. Different to the `generated` column,
  an `auto_initialized` value can be modified after creation.
  The column will not been seen in the model definition.

- **`#[schema(inherent)]`**: The `inherent` annotation indicates that
  the column value is parsed by an associated function in the model's inherent implementation.
